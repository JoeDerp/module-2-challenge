# Noah Fabrick's Challenge 3
This is my folder for week three's challenge.

You can view a live deployment of the password generator [HERE](https://joederp.github.io/module-3-challenge/).

This challenge was the 'Password Generator' challenge in which I had to take some starter code and create a fully functioning custom password generator. It will take in certain criteria and put out a password that follows the given specs.

The selectable password criteria will include:
- Length: 8 to 128 characters
- Characters: Uppercase, Lowercase, Numeric, Special

Here is a snapshot of what the main password generating function looks like:
