# Noah Fabrick's Challenge 3
This is my folder for week three's challenge.

This challenge was the 'Password Generator' challenge in which I had to take some starter code and create a fully functioning custom password generator. It will take in certain criteria and put out a password that follows the given specs.

The selectable password criteria will include:
- Length: 8 to 128 characters
- Characters: Uppercase, Lowercase, Numeric, Special
